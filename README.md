# container_start

I use this script to add a bit of automation for starting the docker containers.

# How the automation script works ?

1. User is asked to select the number corresponding to the image name as printed on screen.
2. The values corresponding to the number entered are pre-defined.
3. These acts as input to the docker run command method definition.

# Note
Kindly check the argument list as it serves my personal purpose. You may need to edit it a bit.
